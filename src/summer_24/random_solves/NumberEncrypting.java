/*
    You need to write a Java program to encrypt a given number by multiplying each digit by 3 and outputting the results. The program will have two encryption methods: one that processes the digits in reverse order and another that processes the digits in the original order. The program will take an integer input and print the encrypted result for both methods.

    Sample Input 1:
    91526


    Sample Output 1:
    Encrypted in original order: 27 3 15 6 18 
    Encrypted in reverse order: 18 6 15 3 27 


    Explanation 1:
    In the given sample input, the number is 91526.

    For the reverse order encryption, the digits are processed from right to left (6, 2, 5, 1, 9), and each digit is multiplied by 3, resulting in 18, 6, 15, 3, 27.

    For the original order encryption, the digits are processed from left to right (9, 1, 5, 2, 6), and each digit is multiplied by 3, resulting in 27, 3, 15, 6, 18.
